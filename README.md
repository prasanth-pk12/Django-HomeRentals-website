# Dream Home Rentals 
<p align="justify">
<b>“ Dream Home Rentals”</b> is a website that allows users to look for available rental houses. The
platform typically includes a user-friendly search module that allows users to enter different criteria
such as location, state, district, city, house type and other specifics, to narrow down the search results.
The results are presented in a clean and well-organized list format, complete with a detailed view
button for each house, making it easy for users to navigate and filter through the results to find their
ideal rental house. To ensure privacy and security for tenants and house owner, the website or
application typically includes a registration module based on phone number and One-time password
(OTP) authentication. To protect the platform from fraud and fake listings, the website also includes a
validation module that can only be accessed by designated super users, such as site administrators. This
module allows them to review, verify and approve or reject the listing of houses added by other users.
